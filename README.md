## Things can be improved
1. Trying to use leaflet minimap to handle mini map, but found I might need more time to do research on this plugin, so I use another way to deal with it: a small size map.
2. For mobile side, I may spend longer time to do the design, so I could handle it in the future.
3. For the background blur, I have no idea how to accomplish the shadow of the blur, need time to research and try.
