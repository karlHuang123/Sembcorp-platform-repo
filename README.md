## Things can be improved
1. Trying to use leaflet minimap to handle mini map, but found I might need more time to do research on this plugin, so I use another way to deal with it: a smaller size map.
2. For mobile side, I may spend longer time to do the design, so I could handle it in the future.
3. For the background blur, I have no idea how to accomplish the shadow of the blur, need time to research and try.
4. Using html dialog for modal, do not have fade in&out animations.
5. Didn't add auto clear feature for search input, can be done in next step.

mobile side:

For mobile side, I hide the daily information box and make a clickable button to control the show&hide of it, as the first picture. The reason why I use a tag button is that if we have more information needed to be shown on the map, we can use a tag button list to handle that, each button refelects to one information modal or popup, just like google map on mobile.
For the detail modal, each part can be scrolled to see the whole information.
